## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: The Problem with Large Images
1. Write a simple Go, Java, or Node.js app (even a "Hello World" is fine)
2. Create a Dockerfile that builds and runs it in a **single stage**
3. Build the image and check its **size**

Note down the size — you'll compare it later.

---

### Task 2: Multi-Stage Build
1. Rewrite the Dockerfile using **multi-stage build**:
   - Stage 1: Build the app (install dependencies, compile)
   - Stage 2: Copy only the built artifact into a minimal base image (`alpine`, `distroless`, or `scratch`)
2. Build the image and check its size again
3. Compare the two sizes

Write in your notes: Why is the multi-stage image so much smaller?

### Task 3: Push to Docker Hub
1. Create a free account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) (if you don't have one)
2. Log in from your terminal
3. Tag your image properly: `yourusername/image-name:tag`
4. Push it to Docker Hub
5. Pull it on a different machine (or after removing locally) to verify

---

### Task 4: Docker Hub Repository
1. Go to Docker Hub and check your pushed image
2. Add a **description** to the repository
3. Explore the **tags** tab — understand how versioning works
4. Pull a specific tag vs `latest` — what happens?
